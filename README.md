These files follow a project that I completed for my Cybersecurity bootcamp where we were asked to harden a Linux server. 
The first is a presentation that goes through every step I took to for pre-hardening the server. 
Day 1 included auditing all users and groups, updating password policies, updating sudo permissions, and validating and updating permissions on files and directories. 
Day 2 included auditing and securing SSH settings, reviewing and updating system packages, disabling unnecessary services, and enabling and configuring logging.
The other two files are the scripts run to ensure all of these steps were taken.
